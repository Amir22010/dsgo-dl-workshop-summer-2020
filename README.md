# Deep Learning Workshop

![](graphics/workshop_lander.gif)


## Goal for Our Time Together
**Train and deploy a production-grade deep learning computer vision model, and have some fun along the way :)**

## Agenda
1. Intro
2. Setting up your computing environment
3. Introduction to our dataset for the day - [MVTech AD](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/) 
4. Getting image classification results fastai with [fastai](https://docs.fast.ai/). 
5. Detection, segmentation, and unsupervised learning. 
6. Deploying models with [docker](https://github.com/moby/moby) and [flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask). 
7. Reflection on studying and working in AI in 2020

## Setting up your computing environment
Installing the software you need to train deep learning models can be difficult. For the purposes of this workshop, we're offering 3 recommended methods of setting up your computing environment. Your level of experience and access to machines, should help you determine which appraoch is right for you. 

| Option | Pros | Cons | Cost | Instructions | 
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------------ | 
| Google Colab | Virtually no setup required, start coding right away! | GPUs not always available, limited session times, limited RAM | Free! There's also a paid tier at [$10/month](https://colab.research.google.com/signup) | [Colab Setup]() |
| Virtual Machine | Highly configurable & flexible, pay for the performance level you need | Can be difficult to configure, only terminal-based interface | Starts ~$1/hour | [Azure VM Setup]() |
| Your Own Linux GPU Machine | No recurring cost, complete control over hardware. | High up-front cost, takes time to configure. | $1000+ fixed up front cost | [Linux Setup]() |



### 1. Setup Google Colab


### 2. Setup an Azure Virtual Machine


### 3. Setup Your Own GPU Machine Running Linux
